### To set up a database, please do the following:

```
- Connect to psql
- Create the database using the psql command CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager;
- Connect to the database using the pqsl command \c bookmark_manager;
- Run the query we have saved in the file 01_create_bookmarks_table.sql
```

### Connect to `psql` and create the `bookmark_manager` and `bookmark_manager_test` databases:

### CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager_test;

## To set up the appropriate tables, connect to each database in `psql` and run the SQL scripts in the `db/migrations` folder in the given order.

### To view bookmarks, navigate to 'localhost:3000/bookmarks'
